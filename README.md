I coded Magic 8 Ball fortune teller, as most of you may know, all you do is ask a question and it will give you an answer. 
However it will first ask for your name then for your question. Within the same page I also coded a shipping company where 
you say how much yopur package weighs in kg and it calculates how much money it would be in ground shipping, premiun ground
shipping and drone shipping, then it will tell you which one is the cheapest so you dont have to pay over priced.
